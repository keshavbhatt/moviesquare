<h3 id="what-are-torrents">What are torrents?</h3>
<p>Torrents are a method of distributing files over the internet. They operate over the BitTorrent protocol to facilitate what’s called peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-bittorrent-seeds-peers-and-trackers">What are BitTorrent seeds, peers and trackers?</h3>
<p>In simple words :</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The people who are uploading data over BitTorrent protocol are called seeders.</em></li>
<li><em>The people who are downloading data over BitTorrent protocol are called leechers.</em></li>
<li><em>A tracker is a special type of server that assists in the communication between peers using the BitTorrent protocol.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>To understand all this in detail, first, let’s take a look at a simpler method of sharing files over more traditional protocol HTTP.</p>
<p><strong>How downloading over HTTP works:</strong></p>
<p>HTTP is used when you download files from a website using your web browser, or something like Download Manager. (For example, when you download Adobe Reader or drivers from manufacturer’s website, it’s usually via HTTP).</p>
<p>How HTTP work is pretty simple. Let’s say Microsoft wants to distribute a 30-day trial of Windows 10. They buy a computer, connect it to the internet, place a copy of the Windows 10 image on its hard drive, and configure some software (like Apache webserver) to allow people to download the image.</p>
<p>When a user wants to download the image, he sends a request to Microsoft’s web server. The web server starts replying with the Windows 10 image data as fast as the internet link between the two of you permits.</p>
<p>When the image is being transferred between the two (server and user), two things are happening simultaneously - upload of the image from the server, and download of the image to the user’s PC. (Think of upload as a person speaking on the phone, and download as a person on the other end taking notes).</p>
<p>This is a pretty simple and convenient method of file sharing.</p>
<p><strong>Some drawbacks of file sharing over http protocol:</strong></p>
<p>Someone needs to set up a server and buy a very fast internet connection. If the server’s internet connection is 500 kb/s - either one client can download at 500 kb/s, or if two clients are downloading, the speed will be divided between them - and each of them will get 250 kb/s. If one of the clients has a slow internet - let’s say capped at 50 kb/s, the other client can download at 450 kb/s. Similarly, if 15 clients with fast internet connections are downloading, none of them will get a speed of more than 33 kb/s (500/15). Suffice it to say, Microsoft’s servers have a very fast internet connection.<br>
It’s vulnerable and easy to block. If you don’t want your users to download Windows images, you just have to block Microsoft’s sites. I can’t think of why non-programmers would want to block Windows image downloads, but in case of censored content (like Government crimes), or illegal content (like pirated movies), or both (NSA leaks), we can see why the government would want to block it.</p>
<p><strong>Now let’s see how torrents solve these problems:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s say you are a person with access to proof of government crime (1GB of files). You tried to host it on a website, but the government blocked it. You now want to share it with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>What you do is - you create a torrent of the file. A torrent is a very small file containing details of the files (names, file sizes, MD5 hashes, etc.) that are shared using that torrent file. You can create it easily using your torrent client (Orion, uTorrent, Azureus, Transmission, etc). You also have to add tracker details to the torrent file. A tracker is a server whose job is to distribute peer lists to new peers (we’ll discuss this in detail).</p>
<p>You host this very small torrent file on some torrent sharing website. People who want to download your government crime proofs go to the torrent website and download the torrent file for it.</p>
<p>They then tell their torrent client to download the files described in the torrent. Since there is no server (like Microsoft’s server for Windows image) to download the torrent from, their torrent client talks to the tracker.</p>
<p>Client - “Dude, any idea where I can get this govt. crime vids?”<br>
Tracker - “Idk man, try these people” (gives the client a list of other people interested in downloading the file)<br>
Client - “Btw, add me to your list. Just in case anyone’s interested” (gives him his IP address)<br>
Tracker - “Whateva, bruh”</p>
<p>Your torrent client goes to each of the people in the list so obtained and asks them if they are interested in sharing the files. Let’s say out of the 48 people in the list, 4 say they have File 1, 3 say they have File 2, and 6 say they have both the files. 9 say that they don’t have any files, but would like to download any files you have. The rest don’t respond (maybe).</p>
<p>So you start downloading File 1 from all of those 4 + 6 people who have it, and File 2 from all of those 3 + 6 people who have it. Since you’re downloading the file, they are uploading it on the other end of the internet connection. Now since you downloaded it and used other people’s internet (in addition to your own), it is your moral responsibility to allow other people to download it from you.</p>
<p><strong>Thus a torrent is a group of (100s or 1000s or more) people collaborating and giving each other pieces of the file until everyone has a copy of the entire file. It starts with the person who created the torrent simply uploading it until many people download, and then they upload it in turn and the torrent spreads.</strong></p>
<p>So if the file is 1GB in size, the creator has to upload at least 1GB for it to spread. Ideally, he’d upload about 3-4GB, and that would give him 3-4 more friends, who’ll help spread it further.</p>
<p>This is why your torrent client is both downloading and uploading the torrent file. Downloading it - so that you can use, and uploading it so that others can also access the file.</p>
<p>All people engaged in the activity of sharing the torrent are called peers.</p>
<p><strong>The people who are uploading are called seeders.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The people who are downloading are called leechers.</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people, however, are both downloading and uploading at the same time and can be called both (downloading parts they don’t have and uploading the ones they do).</p>
<p>If the number of seeders is more, you are likely to download the file faster. If the number of leechers is more, the download is likely to be slow.</p>
<h3 id="advantages-of-torrents">Advantages of torrents:</h3>
<p>Central servers (i.e. the website where you upload the torrent, and the tracker) don’t have to share a lot of data. Both torrent files and peer lists are very small in size, hence these servers don’t cost that much to set up and maintain.<br>
Difficult to block - since no central server is involved in the actual distribution and sharing of the files, it is difficult to block given its distributed nature.<br>
Thus you may realize why uploading (Seeding) is so important to the concept of torrents. You are able to download only because someone else was uploading it for you. A torrent dies quickly if people refuse to upload. (It may also happen that no one wants to download the torrent anymore, and people who are willing to upload don’t find any takers, and after some time they give up and stop uploading that particular torrent).</p>
<h3 id="how-orion-is-the-safest-way-of-accessing-torrents-">How Orion is the safest way of accessing torrents ?</h3>
<p>Usually, the use of torrent sites is prohibited by many ISPs based on the government’s orders, this depends on country to country.<br>
For example, a famous torrent website thepriratebay is blocked in many countries since they provide pirated material. Here it’s necessary to understand how ISP can block the website, they just filter out requests to the IP of the website (say thepiratebay in this case). So, many users who still want to access these websites use VPN services.</p>
<h3 id="how-orion-works">How Orion works:</h3>
<p>Orion by default does not provide any kind of torrent search functionalities.</p>
<p>But with the use of plugins, which are strictly developed with a set of rules to keep the privacy of the user in mind. For example, the search plugin that integrates very well with Orion is very secure by design and is based on guidelines developed by Orion. Infact any plugin that Orion will use only be able to connect with only one private server which is owned by me (developer of this project), Any plugin to be the part of Orion has to submit its backend (must be written in PHP) to me which after deep inspection will be set to work from central server where all components of Orion are stored, this ensure that all transport of queries by plugin occurs on one server, not on the user’s machine which reduces risk of accessing torrent for users and hides all information from ISP of user. So, if you will request search results for a term on search plugin of Orion, Your ISP will never know you ever searched for torrent. To get results, the backend of the search plugin sends the query to my server and returns an encrypted string of results metadata over HTTP protocpl, which can only be decrypted by the plugin after reaching the user’s machine. (Note: Orion never allows any plugin to transfer .torrent file directly, this way your ISP will never know that you downloading a torrent file from the server). The received string which only contains metadata about results is processed by Orion’s hash to torrent file processor. This happens on user’s machine offline, the torrent hash is used to find torrent metadata using BitTorrent protocol and cache the result on local machine of user for further use such as browsing content of the torrent, knowing the size, etc. After this Orion can process the locally produced torrent file cache for all transport that happens on secure BitTorrent protocol.</p>
<p>Want to develop new plugins for Orion? If you are interested in developing and maintaining plugins for Orion you can contact me via email for guidelines. Remember your plugin must meet all requirements before being able to become part of Orion.</p>
